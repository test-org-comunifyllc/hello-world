I am routinely asked if there were an easy way to get a report of all the content published to a category or channel--a content inventory list.  Ideally this list would be similar to the Top Content report in that it would include, Entry ID, Name, Creation Date, Creator --but also include Collaborators (lets face it people leave our company or change roles), Update date, and maybe total plays, and views.  This Content Inventory list would be particularly helpful to groups looking to overhaul their video content completely, or for teams that undergo a reorg.</p>",

As a partial solution we provided a player that has the transcript expanded to start, so that the white space isn't so big when the page first loads. However, it seems that now there's much more white space below even the expanded transcript. Looks like, regardless of the embedsize used, the video automatically \"takes up\" around 824 pixels; this means tons of white space: e.g. if the user selects the smallest size (304x231), they get around 350 pixels of white space below the transcript box. It's not quite as bad for larger embedsizes, but even with the largest default one (608x402) there's still something like 180 pixels of white space below the expanded transcript. </p><p>Is this happening to anybody else?</p><p>And more importantly: if it's not happening to you, would you share how you've set things up (in KMC Studio and in Browseandembed) so that you can provide a player without all the white space (while still providing students a way to view the transcript)? </p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Judy Stern (UC Berkeley)</p>",

Instructors may want to know when a student answered questions, especially when no grade passback is configured, but that data is not included in the Quiz Questions / Quiz Users pages or exports.</p><p> (example below where a test student submitted this response before the date filters I applied).</p><div class=\"embedExternal embedImage display-large float-none\">\n    <div class=\"embedExternal-content\">\n        <a class=\"embedImage-link\" href=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/W7X1K0ZJFWTN/image.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener ugc\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img class=\"embedImage-img\" src=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/W7X1K0ZJFWTN/image.png\" alt=\"User: &quot;image.png&quot;\" height=\"180\" width=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" data-display-size=\"large\" data-float=\"none\"></img></a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p><br></p><p>2. Faculty often import course content from a prior term and it never occurs to them to replace IVQ assignments with a fresh copy of an IVQ. This means that when they go to look at analytics, the data is populated with all the submissions from the prior term(s) and they have no way to filter for the specific course roster of students. If there were a working date filter option (the filter on \"regular\" Analytics doesn't seem to apply), the media owner could filter out prior submissions.</p><p>The workaround right now involves downloaded reports and Excel vlookup wizardry with the course gradebook export, or heaven help us, deep API wizardry. </p><p>Cheers !</p><p>Melinda Kraft, University of Michigan</p>",

Right now we generally do that by viewing the course code and tracking down the entry ID there which can be cumbersome and overwhelming for people not familiar with HTML. </p><p>To make that process easier, one of our student developers - Kade Howes, has built a Chrome Extension that you can click on to identify the Video ID of an embedded Kaltura Video: </p><div class=\"embedExternal embedImage display-large float-none\">\n    <div class=\"embedExternal-content\">\n        <a class=\"embedImage-link\" href=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/HRRICS0EISIL/video-id.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener ugc\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img class=\"embedImage-img\" src=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/HRRICS0EISIL/video-id.png\" alt=\"Browser plugin showing &quot;Display Info&quot; that then displays the video ID on top of a Kaltura video. \" height=\"1016\" width=\"1358\" loading=\"lazy\" data-display-size=\"large\" data-float=\"none\"></img></a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>The plugin is functional, but we are still working through a couple of challenges - especially when it comes to identifying some playlists depending on how they are embedded.

This would be highly useful for instructors to use to add video/audio comments to student assignments  when grading in Speedgrader or for adding video comments in Inbox messages.  Currently, Canvas has their media recorder button available in both of these areas (see screen grab below), but users have no way of adding videos from their My Media to Speedgrader or Inbox comments.  </p><p>In our case, the media recorder button isn't functional, so our faculty don't have any way to add video or audio comments (we're currently working with Canvas on this).  However, even after we get this fixed, the ideal would be for users to have the ability to add videos from their My Media, so they are using the same video workflow throughout Canvas. </p><p>Has anybody else looked into this?

For some cases, we still have galleries that contain multiple channels. In this case, we removed all media within this \"Arts\" gallery and moved the media into 3 channels within that gallery. We encourage folks to upload/add their media to the channels and not to the gallery. However, the \"arts\" gallery is still showing up as an option for folks to publish their media to. In the KMC, I've tried setting the \"Arts\" category/gallery entitlement to \"private\" for \"Content Publishing Permissions\" and that didn't work.

    "body": "<p>Greeting Everyone!</p><p>On August 16th, Penn State <a href=\"https://zoom.psu.edu/2021/08/05/kaltura-zoom-integration-upgrade-on-august-16-2021/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">took the jump and fully embraced the newest Zoom/Kaltura Marketplace Integration</a>.  Not only did we upgrade it... We also configured it to automatically add Zoom recordings, created in the Zoom LTI in Canvas, to the course's Media Gallery.</p><p>This is how it works!  Typically, when an instructor schedules a meeting using the Zoom LTI, tracking_fields are attached to meeting ID information.  <a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000293426-Scheduling-Tracking-Fields\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">These tracking_fields are used for many reasons in Zoom</a>.  Specifically, for Kaltura, they contain which Course Media Gallery (which is a Category in Kaltura) that meeting belongs to.  This information helps direct the Zoom recordings created with that meeting ID to the Course’s Media Gallery in Kaltura.</p><p>Overall, instructors and course designers LOVE the updated integration and it's magic when it publish to the Media Gallery! It's a great time saver and really <a href=\"https://zoom.psu.edu/2021/07/21/find-all-your-zoom-recordings-in-kaltura/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">helps our effort to phase out our university's dependence on Zoom cloud storage</a>.</p><p>However we found a problem with it... </p><p>When an instructor schedules a meeting in Canvas using their Personal Meeting ID (PMI) it attaches the course's tracking_fields to their PMI meeting information.  This causes any additional recordings made with that PMI (regardless of if they are made within the course, a different course, or outside of Canvas entirely) to populate in the original course’s media gallery automatically.  </p><p>This is a HUGE issue because that PMI could be used for recording meetings that may not pertain to the course (i.e., private meetings with students, non-instructional related meetings, etc.) and should not automatically populate the Course’s Media Gallery.  It violates privacy and FERPA policies.  We have brought this issue up with Kaltura a few weeks ago (which we've detailed in the attached document) and provided a possible solution.</p><p>As a workaround, we are <a href=\"https://zoom.psu.edu/2021/08/24/scheduling-zoom-meetings-in-canvas/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">recommending faculty to not to use their PMI for class recordings</a>.  We also developed a script that is leveraging Kaltura and Zoom APIs to monitor each Zoom recording that comes into Kaltura.  It checks if the Zoom Meeting ID is a person's PMI and removes it from the Media Gallery right away.  If the instructor's intent to publish those recordings to their course's Media Gallery in Canvas, they will have to add it manually.</p><p>Our idea here is: Do not allow recordings created with a person Personal Meeting ID (PMI) to automatically publish to a LMS Media Gallery.</p><p>Our Kaltura case number on this request is: 00357265</p><p>What is the community's thoughts on this idea?</p><div class=\"js-embed embedResponsive\" data-embedjson=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/us.v-cdn.net\\/6033889\\/uploads\\/FVI1TQKCUE35\\/kaltura-zoom-pmi-recs-in-cmg.pdf&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Kaltura-Zoom-PMI-Recs-in-CMG.pdf&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;application\\/pdf&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:274237,&quot;displaySize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;float&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;mediaID&quot;:193,&quot;dateInserted&quot;:&quot;2021-09-09T22:23:39+00:00&quot;,&quot;insertUserID&quot;:23,&quot;foreignType&quot;:&quot;embed&quot;,&quot;foreignID&quot;:23,&quot;embedType&quot;:&quot;file&quot;}\">\n    <a href=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/FVI1TQKCUE35/kaltura-zoom-pmi-recs-in-cmg.pdf\" download=\"\" aria-label=\"Kaltura-Zoom-PMI-Recs-in-CMG.pdf\">\n        Kaltura-Zoom-PMI-Recs-in-CMG.pdf\n    </a>\n</div>\n<p><br></p>",

(I know there is <a href=\"https://community.kaltura.com/discussion/comment/739#Comment_739\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">active discussion</a> about the pros/cons of this, but we have it turned on still for now.)</p><p>When the CC label suffix feature was released, I was excited to turn on it on so that the auto-generated machine captions could be identified by users (via the suffix).</p><p>When I turned it on for testing, however, I quickly observed that the label applies to the CC of machine \"Alignment\" jobs as well. And since we use the Alignment feature for our course videos as described above, having the CC label say \"English (auto-generated)\" would not be accurate.</p><p>~~The Idea~~</p><p>In the REACH Profiles and Services Service Parameters settings in the KMC, add one more parameter row beneath \"Machine captions label suffix\" called \"Machine alignment label suffix.\"</p><p>Users (KMC admins) can then select to enable a label suffix for the \"Captions\" jobs or the \"Alignment\" jobs, or both. And in this setup the label could be different for each, of course.</p><p>If this configuration was available right now I'd turn it on in our account today.</p><p><br></p><p>⭐ Thank you for considering my idea.</p>",

    "body": "<p>A short screencast on this topic: <a href=\"https://3194273-6.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_nfv6qa5b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://3194273-6.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_nfv6qa5b</a> </p><p>I recently discussed audio descriptions at Kaltura Office Hours and thought I'd post about it here as well. Audio descriptions are narration added to or combined with the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone. I discuss both how to order REACH v2 audio descriptions and how a Kaltura administrator can manually add an audio description track to a video. I’m hoping some community members may be willing to share some example audio descriptions or experiences with audio description.</p><h2>Ordering an audio description with the REACH v2 3Play service</h2><p>First - here’s an example video with an audio description created with the REACH V2 3Play service: <a href=\"https://3194273-6.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_k5b3tt26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://3194273-6.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_k5b3tt26</a> </p><p>If you are a Kaltura customer, you would work with your RAE to request that the 3Play Audio Description service be enabled and configured for your account and the appropriate REACH profile. You’ll also want to make sure your REACH profile is funded with REACH credits as it is a professional service. Once that’s done ordering an audio description uses the same workflow for ordering captions:</p><ol><li>Search for or select the video you want to order an audio description for.</li><li>Select <strong>Actions → Caption &amp; Enrich</strong>.</li><li>Select the REACH profile with the audio description service.</li><li>Select <strong>Service → Professional</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Feature → Audio Description</strong>.</li><li>Select either <strong>5 Days</strong>, <strong>48 Hours</strong>, or <strong>24 Hours</strong> Turnaround time.</li><li>Select <strong>Submit</strong>.</li></ol><p>Once returned the audio description will automatically be added to the video. You can select it as long as you’re playing the video back with a Kaltura player that has the “audio selector” feature enabled.</p><h2>Adding an audio description manually</h2><p>What if you want to use your own video editor to create an audio description track? How would you add that to a Kaltura video? This workflow is not for the end-user - it is only available to an administrator due to using the Kaltura Management Console and the API. But fear not! It’s not difficult. These instructions assume that:</p><ul><li>You are a Kaltura Administrator with access to the KMC and the API.</li><li>You have already created an audio description file along with your original video. I can try to post something later about creating audio descriptions. There are some good guidelines on the American Council of the Blind website: <a href=\"https://adp.acb.org/guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://adp.acb.org/guidelines.html</a> </li><li>You have both the “English” and “Audio Description” flavors available in your transcoding profile.</li><li>You have a player with the audio selector feature enabled for playing the video with audio description back.</li></ul><p>If you have the access and files ready - here’s how to add an audio description track to a video:</p><ol><li>Login to the Kaltura Management Console: <a href=\"https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/login\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/login</a></li><li>Search for and select the video you want to add an audio description to.</li><li>Select the <strong>Flavors</strong> tab.</li><li>Select the <strong>three dot button</strong> next to the English flavor and select <strong>Upload</strong>.</li><li>Select the original video you uploaded and select <strong>Open</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>three dot button</strong> next to the Audio Description - Eng and select <strong>Upload</strong>.</li><li>Select your audio description track and select <strong>Open</strong>.</li></ol><p>Once everything is processed you can load the video in MediaSpace and play it with a player that has the audio selector feature enabled. Once you play the video you can select between the two different audio tracks. The labels are probably initially incorrect and need to be changed via the API. Here’s how to change the labels via the API:</p><ol><li>In the KMC with the video open make note of the <strong>Asset ID</strong> of both the <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Audio Description - Eng</strong> flavors.</li><li>Open a browser and go to: <a href=\"https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/Overview\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/Overview</a> </li><li>Select the <strong>SIGN IN</strong> button in the upper right. </li><li>Sign in with your KMC credentials.</li><li>In the Navigation search type in <strong>flavor</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>flavorAsset.update</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Try it out</strong> button.</li><li>Enter the <strong>Asset ID</strong> of your audio description flavor in the <strong>id*:string</strong> field.</li><li>Click the <strong>+</strong> next to object to display all the different fields we can update.</li><li>Enter <strong>Audio Description</strong> (or whatever you’d like) in the label:string field.</li><li>You can also select another <strong>language:string</strong> if you’d like, but the label is what will appear in the player if the flavor has a label.</li><li>Scroll back up and select the <strong>Send Request</strong> button. </li><li>Repeat these steps on the English flavor if you need to.</li><li>Reload the video - it should now play and allow you to select the audio tracks with the correct labels.</li></ol><p>I mentioned that we discussed audio description at Kaltura Office Hours. If you want to review those sessions they are available here:</p><ul><li>4/13/21 Office Hours - <a href=\"https://eduteam.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_hnvsddhj?st=2217\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://eduteam.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_hnvsddhj?st=2217</a> </li><li>10/26/21 Office Hours - <a href=\"https://eduteam.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_7yxhswm0?st=963\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://eduteam.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_7yxhswm0?st=963</a> </li></ul><p>You do need a login to eduteam to get access to the Office Hours recordings.

Instead of making blanket assumptions, or just trying to mimic what someone else has done, I wanted to seek some feedback from you all to flex your community muscle <span class=\"safeEmoji nativeEmoji\">💪</span>.</p><ul><li>What are your thoughts and/or interest in that (there are some pedagogical, etc concerns obviously)?</li><li>How should it be controlled?  Should every video adhere to this? Control on a per-video basis? Global controls?  Per-course controls?  All of the above and then some?</li><li>What should count as completion?  100%?  What should happen when a user stops a few seconds shy of the end (maybe in impatience)?</li><li>How should this be presented in the gradebook?</li></ul><p>Other thoughts? <span class=\"safeEmoji nativeEmoji\">💭</span></p>",

All of this subscriber analytics would allow our users to monitor channel engagement and increase the use of the platform. </p><p>I believe this would be possible using the API call “categoryUser.list”.

The digital (and then HD era) along with software processing has made it so most video will look at least \"pretty good\" even with terrible lighting.  But you can seriously up your lighting game inexpensively (and safely) to take your videos to the next level without too much effort!  Below are some budget friendly options for improving your lighting setups in some common situations.  <em>Also, the usual disclaimer</em>:  These are not sponsored items or links.  The item links may be from Amazon but are for reference and information, and are not referral links.  (It just happens to be where I got them.) I have no connection to any of these items and am not recommending them in any official capacity.  These are items I have personally used and reflect my own opinions only. </p><p>Learning a bit about lighting theory will help, and while not explicitly necessary I'm going to tell you about it anyway.  Becoming a lighting expert takes a lifetime, but a grasp on the concept of how 3 point lighting works will help you understand why, how, and where you should use lights.  In the shortest, most simplified way to start thinking about it, great lighting will generally start with a system called 3 point lighting, which uses light coming from (unsurprisingly, given the name) 3 sources: <strong> Key</strong> light, <strong>Fill </strong>light, and <strong>Back </strong>light.  The key light is aimed at your subject, slightly to one side, with the most intensity.  The fill light comes from the other side and generally has 50-75% of the intensity of the key light.  And the back light comes from (you guessed it) the back of the subject, from the side and above (usually) to give a little highlight and separate the subject from the background to create depth.  Since this is a gear post I'm not really giving this the detail it deserves, but understanding the basic concept will help you pick lights and have some idea of where to put them.  If you want to learn more about 3 point lighting, here's a couple of links to start with:</p><div class=\"js-embed embedResponsive\" data-embedjson=\"{&quot;body&quot;:&quot;How the standard 3 point lighting technique works for video, film and television, photography, etc.&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/www.mediacollege.com\\/lighting\\/three-point\\/&quot;,&quot;embedType&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Three Point Lighting&quot;}\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.mediacollege.com/lighting/three-point/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">\n        https://www.mediacollege.com/lighting/three-point/\n    </a>\n</div><div class=\"js-embed embedResponsive\" data-embedjson=\"{&quot;body&quot;:&quot;Want to learn about three-point lighting?

Also, you might have noticed I mentioned safety earlier.  In the \"old\" days professional lights were hot lights.  Besides being heavy and expensive, many of them got hot enough to set anything they touch on fire and melt the skin from any part of your body they touched.  There is no need whatsoever to use those kind of lights anymore (for our purposes here) and even color-corrected fluorescents aren't necessary anymore.  (While less dangerous, they're still heavy and expensive.)  LEDs are cheap, cool to the touch, comparatively lightweight, can have great color reproduction (and even color shifting) for a fraction of the price.</p><p>Color temperature is another thing that we really don't want to dive too deep on, but it's important to have a basic understanding of color temp and CRI for LEDs.  So this is another area where you can read much, MUCH more than what I'll write here.  Color temp is measured on a Kelvin scale. Generally - a yellow/orange \"warm\" look (tungsten) is in the 27-3200k range, and white \"cool\" (daylight) is in the 5600k range.  (You'll often see a similar scale printed on the box of the lightbulbs you're using right in your own house.  Go take a look.  Do it.)  If you want a warm look, look for the lower range, and if you want a cool look get lights in the upper range.  (Some LEDs will do color shifting across multiple color temperatures, which is a nice plus.)  You generally don't want to mix color temps, pick a look and stick with it.  If you have room lights you have to consider (like ceiling mounted fluorescents in your office) you can look up the color temp online to incorporate that into your other choices.  (And again, modern cameras and sensors are very forgiving.)  You can learn more about the color temperature scale here:  <a href=\"https://lightingdesignstudio.co.uk/colour-temperature/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://lightingdesignstudio.co.uk/colour-temperature/</a></p><p>OK, one more theory item to talk about before we get into actual gear.  CRI, or Color Rendering Index.  Look for a CRI in the 90s (the closer to 100 the better) for better color reproduction.  Cheap LEDs sometimes have a low CRI and will make you look like you're ill.  You can always turn to Wikipedia to learn more:  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_rendering_index\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_rendering_index</a></p><p>Despite my attempts to scale that all down, it's still pretty verbose.  Sorry.  I love to hear myself talk, even if it's just in my own head as I type.  But anyway, for those of us with champagne taste on a Miller Lite budget, here are some lights I've bought and used personally over the years with great success!</p><p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong>  Sitting at your desk, in your home office, working remotely.  This is my setup right now at home, my home office is setup in the basement, and I have a fluorescent fixture above me, to the left, which acts as both a key and back light (because it's 4 feet long and where my desk falls is about in the middle of it running front-to-back.)  So if I only used that light I'd have very harsh shadows on the right side of my face, due to most of the intensity of the light coming from the left.  There are other lights in the room, but they're further away and do little to add anything other than some minor fill.  I'm using a Logitech c910 webcam which is a pretty decent sensor, but also old at this point (8ish years.)  It gets the job done, but any webcam, even a brand new one, is still going to have a very small sensor that will be compensating for lighting on the software-side.  That will add graininess, lack of detail, and probably lack of color saturation.  So if you can light yourself well you can vastly improve the performance of your webcam recordings.  I added this small LED ring light, clamped to the right side of my desk to add fill:</p><div class=\"js-embed embedResponsive\" data-embedjson=\"{&quot;body&quot;:&quot;Clip Light Reading Lights - QQAPPU 24 LED Clamp-on Desk Lamp with 3 Color Modes and 10 Brightness Dimmable, 360 ° Flexible Gooseneck Book Clamp Light for Video Conference Lighting Headboard - - Amazon.com&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/smile.amazon.com\\/Clip-Light-Reading-Lights-Brightness\\/dp\\/B07WMRQQQ7&quot;,&quot;embedType&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Clip Light Reading Lights - QQAPPU 24 LED Clamp-on Desk Lamp with 3 Color Modes and 10 Brightness Dimmable, 360 ° Flexible Gooseneck Book Clamp Light for Video Conference Lighting Headboard - - Amazon.com&quot;}\">\n    <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Clip-Light-Reading-Lights-Brightness/dp/B07WMRQQQ7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">\n        https://smile.amazon.com/Clip-Light-Reading-Lights-Brightness/dp/B07WMRQQQ7\n    </a>\n</div><p>Note that it has adjustable color modes and intensity/brightness and runs off of standard 5v USB power.  (I have it plugged into the USB hub on my keyboard.)  The flexible neck makes it  easy to position and it remembers the last color/intensity setting when you turn it on.  This particular light doesn't give a CRI rating, but I've found it quite acceptable for webcam usage.  Also, the color settings only have 3 choices (rather than something variable) but it's worked out perfectly for my needs.  (and it's $15)  Since it's a ring light and on a flexible neck, you could even position it so your webcam shoots through it, if needed.  Since in 3 point lighting you're looking for subtle contrast between your key and fill (remember we talked about how a fill light is lower intensity than the key light) so adjustable brightness gives you a lot of flexibility in fine tuning the look to create some contrast and depth without harsh shadows.  Making your key and fill the same intensity will result in a flat, boring look.</p><p>I also have this one which I thought I might use as an eye light (which is a type not mentioned before now, surprise!)  An eye light is used to cut the shadows you get under your eyes when lights are coming from above and you're not getting enough bounce or fill from other lights, so you see shadows/dark circles/etc on your eyes.  (Not everyone agrees on eye light definitions, terminology, or use cases, like everything else with lighting, but this is how I've always understood it.)</p><div class=\"js-embed embedResponsive\" data-embedjson=\"{&quot;body&quot;:&quot;Amazon.com: LED Clip Reading Light USB Powered Reading Lamp, Dimmable Touch Switch Book Light for Reading in Bed at Night, Flexible Gooseneck Laptop Light for Bed Bedside Desktop Table Notebook PC MAC Computer : Tools &amp; Home Improvement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/smile.amazon.com\\/gp\\/product\\/B07HMCN3G6\\/&quot;,&quot;embedType&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Amazon.com: LED Clip Reading Light USB Powered Reading Lamp, Dimmable Touch Switch Book Light for Reading in Bed at Night, Flexible Gooseneck Laptop Light for Bed Bedside Desktop Table Notebook PC MAC Computer : Tools &amp; Home Improvement&quot;}\">\n    <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HMCN3G6/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">\n        https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HMCN3G6/\n    </a>\n</div><p>Ultimately, this small LED stick light ended up being unnecessary for me, as the color temp isn't adjustable and it was too far off from the other lights (and looked a little green on camera.)   But the clip, flexible gooseneck, and 5v USB power are still nice features.  So ultimately, just the room lights and the addition of the ring light helped immensely with improving the overall look of my webcam recordings for Personal Capture, Express Capture, Virtual Classroom, and anywhere else I use my webcam.</p><p><strong>Scenario 2</strong>:  Small Studio/One-Button Studio/Multimedia Space/etc.</p><p>This is another area where LEDs really shine for versatility, affordability, and safety.  I spent decades (ouch, but I digress) using predominantly hot lights both in-studio and for location shooting.  They can be expensive and unreliable (bulbs burn out at the worst time) but ultimately you can work magic with how they look.  The biggest problem is safety - traditional studio lights will easily start fires and sear the flesh off your skin in seconds, so they're not ideal for a small, self-service space you might set up on campus.  A mandatory part of any gaffers kit is always thick canvas gloves for touching/adjusting lights and housings, and a small fire extinguisher.  (The Gaffer is the chief electrician on a set, and works closely with the director of photography or lighting director on lighting.)  So on a small production, the person touching the lights, if not the DP, is the de facto gaffer.  (insert themoreyouknow.gif here.)  Anyway, for almost all of our purposes, none of that is necessary anymore.  For any setup you're likely to put together, LEDs are the way to go.  We used several sets of these for both location shooting and small studio spaces, and they're amazing for the price.  They have a great CRI, are dimmable as well as color-shifting, and have <em>real</em> barn doors:</p><div class=\"js-embed embedResponsive\" data-embedjson=\"{&quot;body&quot;:&quot;Amazon.com : Neewer 2 Packs 660 LED Video Light with APP Control, Photography Video Lighting Kit with Light Stands, Dimmable 45W Bi-Color 3200K-5600K CRI 97+ with Diffuser\\/Barndoor\\/Bag for Studio YouTube Shooting : Electronics&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/smile.amazon.com\\/Neewer-Photography-Lighting-Dimmable-3200K-5600K\\/dp\\/B08216G3NB\\/&quot;,&quot;embedType&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Amazon.com : Neewer 2 Packs 660 LED Video Light with APP Control, Photography Video Lighting Kit with Light Stands, Dimmable 45W Bi-Color 3200K-5600K CRI 97+ with Diffuser\\/Barndoor\\/Bag for Studio YouTube Shooting : Electronics&quot;}\">\n    <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Neewer-Photography-Lighting-Dimmable-3200K-5600K/dp/B08216G3NB/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">\n        https://smile.amazon.com/Neewer-Photography-Lighting-Dimmable-3200K-5600K/dp/B08216G3NB/\n    </a>\n</div><p>I say \"real\" barn doors because, inexplicably, some low-cost LED lights use shiny, reflective metal barn doors.  This is not what you want.  Barn doors are meant to <em>shape</em> the light, not reflect it, and should always be matte black, never shiny.  (*puts away soapbox*)  For the cost, these lights can't be beat (there are other combinations without the battery adapters and light stands that can be about $50 cheaper, give or take.)  I used them for several years and expect that they're still in use today at my previous institution.  They look really good on camera, which you'd expect with a high CRI rating.</p><p>These are also a good option for an even lower budget, but also for unusual size constraints (sometimes you're trying to create a small studio in a confined space like a library study room or small office.)  They claim a CRI of greater than 90 (but don't offer any specifics.)  I might find that a little odd, but I've used these and they work out really nicely.  They are super lightweight and can work great mounted in a corner using something like a wall mount right angle baby pin.  (Prices vary greatly on mounting hardware, but you should be able to find them for ~$20ish.)  They'll be much better in a small space than a light stand or wall mount arm.</p><div class=\"js-embed embedResponsive\" data-embedjson=\"{&quot;body&quot;:&quot;Amazon.com : GSKAIWEN Photography Studio LED Lighting Kit Adjustable Light with Light Stand Tripod Photographic Video Capture Portraits : Electronics&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/smile.amazon.com\\/gp\\/product\\/B0722RSD3P&quot;,&quot;embedType&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Amazon.com : GSKAIWEN Photography Studio LED Lighting Kit Adjustable Light with Light Stand Tripod Photographic Video Capture Portraits : Electronics&quot;}\">\n    <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0722RSD3P\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">\n        https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0722RSD3P\n    </a>\n</div><p>These stick lights can also be good for lighting up a green screen with some nice, even light for chroma-keying.  But it's worth checking if you can get a clean key without them.  I used to always light green screens independently (because it was 100% necessary to get a clean key) but I found in recent years that there is sometimes no difference with modern keying software.  If the shadows being cast on your green screen from your lighting design aren't too harsh, you may not need anything additional at all to flatten them out.  Give it a try in your software of choice before you bother lighting it independently.</p><p>For wall mounting any of these, a right angle baby pin like this is a great space saver:</p><div class=\"js-embed embedResponsive\" data-embedjson=\"{&quot;body&quot;:&quot;Amazon.com : Sunset Foto Right Angled Baby Wall Plate with 5\\/8 Stud 9x15cm Plate Photo Studio Light Stand : Electronics&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Sunset-Foto-Angled-9x15cm-Studio\\/dp\\/B086TVD4JB&quot;,&quot;embedType&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Amazon.com : Sunset Foto Right Angled Baby Wall Plate with 5\\/8 Stud 9x15cm Plate Photo Studio Light Stand : Electronics&quot;}\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sunset-Foto-Angled-9x15cm-Studio/dp/B086TVD4JB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">\n        https://www.amazon.com/Sunset-Foto-Angled-9x15cm-Studio/dp/B086TVD4JB\n    </a>\n</div><p>Make sure you measure the wall clearance AND check the weight of your lights, use the appropriate wall anchors for the weight.  (I've used these right angle pins several times in different mounting situations with a great deal of success.)  They have four holes for easy hardware mounting.  The wall anchors at the hardware store (or anywhere else) will have a weight range on the box - find out what you need then buy the next size up.  Always err on the conservative side when attaching heavy electrical things to your walls.</p><p>I've tried to make this all easily digestible, but it's still a lot to take in.  The point is, there's a ton of budget-friendly gear out there if you think creatively and experiment a bit.  If you have any questions please post below and I'll do my best to answer them.  Also, if you have a specific suggestion for a future Gadget Corner post, let me know!</p>",

Now, I'm transitioning into a role where I will manage the back end for users, which will mean that most of my clients will be professors, and sometimes students. Our LMS has been Moodle for a number of years, but we are in the process of choosing either to stay with Moodle or move to another LMS.</p><p>There is a lot of detailed technical information about Kaltura, I've seen, but my hope is that, between my supervisor and the community here, I will learn what the most common and most important services are that I must learn to provide.

    "url": "https://community.kaltura.com/discussion/208/gadget-corner-hdmi-to-usb-capture-devices",
    "body": "<p>Hi gang!  I thought I'd start some threads on a topic near and dear to my heart, cheap gear!  These are all things that work with Kaltura, or at least are Kaltura-adjacent in some way.  I have a great love for finding no-name gear and gadgets online and testing them to see if they work as well as advertised.  In most cases I order from Amazon because of easy returns for Prime items (if it doesn't work) so no harm done other than time spent experimenting.</p><p>And when I say they \"work with Kaltura\" I am speaking from my own personal experience, I'm either using them right now or I have in the past (depending on the item.)  So I am not representing Kaltura or any specific device (because the branding frequently changes, and the internals may change as well) but I can tell you about my first-hand experiences using them.  Also, any links are purely for informational purposes - no affiliate links (from me or anyone else) but generally I get these items from Amazon.  (With occasional forays into B&amp;H, Adorama, etc.)</p><p>First up - USB video capture.  I've used a LOT of gear over the years to get HDMI or SDI video signals into computers.  There are a lot of great devices from major brands that are heavy duty and meant to run 24/7 in professional settings.  They can be hundreds and even thousands of dollars, and they're devices I'd trust to put in classrooms, auditoriums, etc.  These are not those devices.  These are a few items I wanted to keep on my desk and place around my home office (connected to budget-action cameras, a story for another post) so I'd easily be able to use a variety of sources for Kaltura Capture, Virtual Classroom, Express Capture, Kaltura Classroom, etc.  They don't run 24/7, but I do use them regularly and they serve me well.  I have 3 total, the first are two of these:</p><p><a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Capture-Streaming-Broadcasting-Conference-Teaching/dp/B09FLN63B3/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://smile.amazon.com/Capture-Streaming-Broadcasting-Conference-Teaching/dp/B09FLN63B3/</a></p><p>I have had these about a year, plugged into a USB3 hub that's plugged into my laptop.  They take HDMI in and spit out a UVC compliant video signal.  They are recognized as a webcam in anything that's looking for a webcam as a source.   When I got them they were $11.  They're still pretty inexpensive, you can look around and find a matching device under many different brand names for different prices, but (I believe) the internals are the same.  These have been solid workhorses for me for close to a year, and allow me to show off different USB sources without conflicting with one another, such as in this Kaltura Classroom 4-input example.  This is 1 Logitech webcam and 2 HDMI action cams plugged into the 2 dongles on input 1 and 4:</p><div class=\"embedExternal embedImage display-large float-none\">\n    <div class=\"embedExternal-content\">\n        <a class=\"embedImage-link\" href=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/48SMS8T4ZOVM/image.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener ugc\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img class=\"embedImage-img\" src=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/48SMS8T4ZOVM/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" height=\"499\" width=\"665\" loading=\"lazy\" data-display-size=\"large\" data-float=\"none\"></img></a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>A few months into this I realized it would be useful to have another one for an additional input, but this time I sought out something with an HDMI loop through so I could add a confidence monitor, if needed.  (And also to get one that was USB3, the others are USB2.)  Unfortunately the exact model I got is no longer available on Amazon and I can't find one that matches exactly.  Here is what mine looks like (you can see the other two dongles in the pic also, at the top - apologies for the dust.)</p><div class=\"embedExternal embedImage display-large float-none\">\n    <div class=\"embedExternal-content\">\n        <a class=\"embedImage-link\" href=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/SBQG2YHJ1CSN/image.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener ugc\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img class=\"embedImage-img\" src=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/SBQG2YHJ1CSN/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" height=\"911\" width=\"1234\" loading=\"lazy\" data-display-size=\"large\" data-float=\"none\"></img></a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p><br></p><p>This also works amazingly well and adds an HDMI passthrough.  I can run all 3 of these inputs and my webcam as a 4th input with no issue on my Windows laptop.  I've used them with Kaltura Capture, Express Capture, Kaltura Classroom, Virtual Classroom, as well as other software like OBS to live stream RTMP to Kaltura.  Just like with the other two, this presents to the computer the same as any webcam, and will be recognized in any platform looking for a USB device.</p><p>I've been using this for several months, also with no issues, simultaneously with the other two.  Having a capture with an HDMI loop out to a monitor has been useful for an ad-hoc confidence monitor as well as reducing input lag for streaming devices where you might be concerned with input lag.  :D  This specific device doesn't seem to be currently available, but it was in the $35ish range from Amazon.  This seems fairly close, but is not identical:</p><p><a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Microphone-Loop-Out-Recorder-Streaming-Conference/dp/B09444NK3F/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://smile.amazon.com/Microphone-Loop-Out-Recorder-Streaming-Conference/dp/B09444NK3F/</a></p><p>But if I was looking to get something else to experiment with right now, I'd give that one a try.  Happy to continue the discussion, questions, comments, or hear your own experiences!</p>",

    "body": "<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I had an idea to start to pull out some of the things we've discussed in Kaltura Office Hours and add them to the Kaltura Community. This topic seemed to generate interest from a couple participants - I'm hoping to hear more on if or how you're using Google Analytics with Kaltura players. A couple resources:</p><p>I created a Google Doc which is a duplicate of the instructions here: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3nEVFot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://bit.ly/3nEVFot</a></p><p>I also created a short screencast on the topic: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/39dg0J2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://bit.ly/39dg0J2</a> </p><p>I'm not a Google Analytics expert but I learned enough with the help of my former colleague Peter Burke that I was able to connect Google Analytics up to our players at my former institution when I was a Kaltura admin. I found them to be a great help - particularly in determining what players were in use, and some live stats on how many users were viewing Kaltura media with players connected to Google Analytics. They are a nice add-on to Kaltura's own analytics. </p><p>Before we start I should note that if you have data governance or security experts on campus you should check with them before enabling or integrating Google Analytics with your production instance players.</p><p><strong>Create a Google Analytics account</strong><br></p><p>These instructions assume you’ve never used Google analytics before and need to create an account and analytics property:</p><ol><li>Go to <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://analytics.google.com/</a> </li><li>Click <strong>Start measuring</strong> if you haven’t worked with Google Analytics before.</li><li>Enter an <strong>Account name</strong>. </li><li>Select the Account Data Sharing Settings that work for you.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Enter a <strong>Property name</strong>.</li><li>Make sure the <strong>Reporting time zone</strong> lines up with your time zone.</li><li>By default Google Analytics will have you create a Google Analytics 4 property to measure your data.

The link allows for viewing by the non-member as long as that non-member has recently accessed some other Media Gallery (one in a site which they are a member). Besides this being a potential FERPA violation (if, for example, the videos include recordings of students), faculty are under the impression that their content is restricted to those who are members of the site to which they’ve published.</p><p>We've opened a Case about this (and reached out to our RAE), but haven't heard back, and I'm having a tough time believing this wouldn't have been an issue at other institutions, so hoping that there's some KAF config setting we might be missing, and that we can fix it in short order.</p><p>Judy</p>",

We've have been <a href=\"https://zoom.psu.edu/2021/07/21/find-all-your-zoom-recordings-in-kaltura/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">phasing out our university's dependence on Zoom cloud storage</a> and encouraging everyone to use Kaltura for sharing their Zoom recordings.  Since then many people here have missed the feature in Zoom that I think Kaltura can help with.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong></p><p>Several departments have administrative professionals, learning designers, or other support staff schedule Zoom meetings on behalf of another person, while adding themselves as an alternate host. There are also people that include others as alternate hosts to assist with managing the meeting, and/or the recording within Zoom.</p><p>Since Penn State has encouraged our students, staff, and faculty to use Kaltura for long-term storage for Zoom recordings, many users are looking for this same functionality in Kaltura. The meeting host would like to have their alternate hosts to be able to access their recording in Kaltura without requiring the entry owner (Zoom meeting host) to log in to Kaltura and give the person co-editor/co-publisher permissions.</p><p><strong>Suggested Solutions:</strong></p><p>We suggest adding the following features to occur within Kaltura when a person is an alternate host for a Zoom meeting:</p><ol><li> If configured in the Zoom/Kaltura integration to do so, automatically add the Zoom meeting’s alternate hosts as co-editors to the entry so the entry appears in their \"My Media\"</li><li>If the “Your entry is ready” notifications are enabled in Kaltura and #1 is enabled, send the same notification to co-editors for the entry.</li></ol><p><strong>Details for Suggestion 1:</strong></p><p>In the Zoom Integration settings in the Kaltura Management Console (KMC), add setting to automatically add alternate hosts as co-editors to the entry.</p><div class=\"embedExternal embedImage display-large float-none\">\n    <div class=\"embedExternal-content\">\n        <a class=\"embedImage-link\" href=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/2BI3K7W0MP60/screen-shot-2021-09-13-at-4-12-32-pm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener ugc\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img class=\"embedImage-img\" src=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/2BI3K7W0MP60/screen-shot-2021-09-13-at-4-12-32-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-09-13 at 4.12.32 PM.png\" height=\"150\" width=\"525\" loading=\"lazy\" data-display-size=\"large\" data-float=\"none\"></img></a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p><em>Mockup of the proposed Zoom Integration settings in the KMC for alternate hosts</em></p><p>If the Kaltura Admin selects “Add as Co-Publishers” or “Add as Co-Editors” in the integration settings, then the alternate hosts get access to the entry based on their selection.

Specifically, analytics related to IVQ are available exclusively through the front end user dashboards (KMS/KAF), and the ability to manage a quiz (add/remove a question, delete a user's response, etc.) are, equally,  only available through KMS/KAF. So when a user requests assistance with any of these functions, an admin must assign themselves as a co-editor or owner of the entry in order to manage it on the user's behalf through KMS/KAF, as none of these functions can be accomplished through KMC.</p><p>Adding this functionality to KMC would streamline workflows and allow admins to better support their users.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Raul @ Oregon State</p>",

    "body": "<p>This feature request has been submitted as Customer Care #00356111.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>As Kaltura admins we struggle with how to inform KMS/KAF users about things they need to know in Kaltura. To help address this problem, here is a feature request: </p><h3>Feature Request</h3><p>Immediately to the right of all headings in the web UI (H1 through H3 might suffice?), provide a unique but empty msgstr placeholder that accepts HTML. </p><h3>Justification</h3><p>If implemented, Kaltura admins would be able to use the Language module's LanguageException process to add documentation to a given page. For example, in the case of needing to tell users something they MUST know, they could add a couple bullets of text below the page heading. Or, admins would be able to insert a question mark/info icon and link to the right of a page heading, to give users the option to learn more about what that page does. </p><h3>Related Language Exception Examples</h3><p>For some examples of Language Exceptions we have implemented along these lines: </p><h4>Type 1: Adding important information bullets to a page </h4><h5>Kaltura Express Recorder Language Exception</h5><p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had a lot of new users, and some of them started using the Express Recorder for recordings that were too long, thought it would record their desktop, etc. The Recorder module's maxRecordingTime setting doesn't warn users before recording stops which is very jarring. So, to give context around this tool, we added a couple bullet points with a link to more information over at <a href=\"https://it.umn.edu/services-technologies/comparisons/compare-video-recording-tools\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer ugc\">https://it.umn.edu/services-technologies/comparisons/compare-video-recording-tools</a>. </p><div class=\"embedExternal embedImage display-large float-none\">\n    <div class=\"embedExternal-content\">\n        <a class=\"embedImage-link\" href=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/LQCATXP97CSR/kaltura-express-recorder-language-exception.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener ugc\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img class=\"embedImage-img\" src=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/LQCATXP97CSR/kaltura-express-recorder-language-exception.png\" alt=\"Kaltura Express Recorder Language Exception.png\" height=\"1031\" width=\"1192\" loading=\"lazy\" data-display-size=\"large\" data-float=\"none\"></img></a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>We have click stats on that link.

But, if even just one of those clicks resulted in a instructor understanding Analytics' limitations before accusing a student of not watching assigned videos (or at least triggering a conversation between them), it will have been worth it. </p><div class=\"embedExternal embedImage display-large float-none\">\n    <div class=\"embedExternal-content\">\n        <a class=\"embedImage-link\" href=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/JOI7L0E4CXBQ/kaltura-analytics-language-exception-stats.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener ugc\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img class=\"embedImage-img\" src=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/JOI7L0E4CXBQ/kaltura-analytics-language-exception-stats.png\" alt=\"Kaltura Analytics Language Exception - stats.png\" height=\"1166\" width=\"1463\" loading=\"lazy\" data-display-size=\"large\" data-float=\"none\"></img></a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p><br></p><h4>Type 2: Adding an info icon to so users can elect to learn more </h4><h5>Kaltura Quick Ingest Language Exception </h5><p>Within the KAF Browse, Search, and Embed process, we implemented Quick Ingest in January 2021.

It is possible to use the msgid \"Media Gallery\" to add an icon/link in context, as seen in the screenshot below:</p><div class=\"embedExternal embedImage display-large float-none\">\n    <div class=\"embedExternal-content\">\n        <a class=\"embedImage-link\" href=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/RA7QEUSZWW07/media-gallery-language-exception.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener ugc\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img class=\"embedImage-img\" src=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/RA7QEUSZWW07/media-gallery-language-exception.png\" alt=\"Media Gallery Language Exception.png\" height=\"1166\" width=\"1463\" loading=\"lazy\" data-display-size=\"large\" data-float=\"none\"></img></a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>However, doing that breaks Browse, Search, and Embed, as seen in the screenshot below:</p><div class=\"embedExternal embedImage display-large float-none\">\n    <div class=\"embedExternal-content\">\n        <a class=\"embedImage-link\" href=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/JYMFD2ZBBSWE/media-gallery-language-exception-breaks-bse.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener ugc\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img class=\"embedImage-img\" src=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/6033889/uploads/JYMFD2ZBBSWE/media-gallery-language-exception-breaks-bse.png\" alt=\"Media Gallery Language Exception - breaks BSE.png\" height=\"1166\" width=\"1463\" loading=\"lazy\" data-display-size=\"large\" data-float=\"none\"></img></a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>To the right of the <strong>My Media </strong>tab, there should be <strong>Media Gallery</strong>, and <strong>Media Gallery Playlists</strong> tabs, but the trying to add a link in the Media Gallery msgid breaks those options. </p><p>I'll be interested to know how others might use this feature request, or something like it, as well.</p><p><br></p><h3>Footnote about Media Gallery <strong>Channel Actions</strong> menu label</h3><p>In the KAF Media Gallery, when users hover over the Actions menu, they see the text \"Channel Actions\". This wording is confusing to users, since they may have never heard of a \"Channel\". They are in a Media Gallery, not a Channel. We opened case #00319825 (aka SUP-23258) about this issue in July 2020 and asked about it again in July 2021. It is still pending review. </p><p><br></p><p>Alex Anderson @ University of Minnesota</p>",
